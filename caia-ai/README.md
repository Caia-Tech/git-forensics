# gaia: Gate-Based AI Experiments

## What Is This?
Experimenting with logic gates as the foundation for AI, because current AI is expensive theater.

Part of the Caia Tech suite:
- **gaia**: Transparent AI through logic gates (this project)
- **GitForensics**: Cryptographic evidence and audit trails
- **AFDP**: Workflow intelligence and transparency
- **Together**: Fully auditable, explainable AI systems

## Current Experiments:

### 1. Pure Gates
Basic AND, OR, XOR, NAND operations. The fundamentals.

### 2. Memory Gates  
Gates that remember previous states. Output depends on current AND past inputs.

### 3. Superposition
Probabilistic states that don't collapse until observed/needed. Quantum-inspired.

### 4. Adaptive Gates
Gates that can learn and adjust their behavior based on feedback.

### 5. Gate Networks
Connecting multiple gates to create complex behaviors from simple components.

## Philosophy
- Why use billions of parameters when you can use logic gates?
- Why use probabilities when you can use deterministic logic?
- Why use GPUs when a MacBook CPU is enough?

## Status
Active experimentation. Everything is on the table.

## Build & Run
```bash
make run              # Run basic demo
gcc -o experiments experiments.c && ./experiments  # Run all experiments
```

## Next Ideas:
- Hierarchical gate networks
- Gates that build other gates
- Pattern recognition with pure logic
- Binary models that choose gate configurations
- Hybrid deterministic/probabilistic systems
- Self-modifying gate networks

Remember: The "experts" said digital currency was impossible too.

## ðŸš¨ Funding Needed ðŸš¨

I've given away three revolutionary technologies completely free:
- **GitForensics**: Cryptographic evidence preservation
- **AFDP**: Workflow intelligence for transparent AI
- **gaia**: AI without neural networks or GPUs

I'm currently operating with $0 in my bank account while disrupting a $500B industry. If you use this technology, benefit from it, or believe in democratizing AI, please support this work.

**Every dollar helps me continue innovating instead of struggling to survive.**
